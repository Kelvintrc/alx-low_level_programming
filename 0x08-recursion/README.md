# 0x08. C - Recursion

		Tasks:

0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget - prints a string, followed by a new line using Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together - Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s); prints a string in reverse.
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange - Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s); returns the length of a string.
