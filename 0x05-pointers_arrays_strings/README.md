#0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

		Tasks:

0. 98 Battery st. - Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n) takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream - swaps the values of two integers using Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b)
2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read - returns the length of a string using Prototype: int _strlen(char *s)
3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them - void_puts(char *str) function prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
