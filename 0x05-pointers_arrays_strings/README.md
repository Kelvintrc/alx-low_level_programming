#0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

		Tasks:

0. 98 Battery st. - Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n) takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream - swaps the values of two integers using Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b)
2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read - returns the length of a string using Prototype: int _strlen(char *s)
3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them - void_puts(char *str) function prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear - Prototype: void print_rev(char *s) prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes - Prototype: void rev_string(char *s) reverses a string.
6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true - Prototype: void puts2(char *str) prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half - Prototype: void puts_half(char *str) prints half of a string, followed by a new line. Prints the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function prints the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
8. Arrays are not pointers -
