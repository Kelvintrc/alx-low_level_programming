# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

		Tasks:

0. isupper - checks for uppercase character.

1. isdigit - checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2. Collaboration is multiplication - multiplies two integers.

3. The numbers speak for themselves - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4. I believe in numbers and signs - prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5. Numbers constitute the only universal language - prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line - draws a straight line in the terminal.

7. I feel like I am diagonally parked i a parallel universe - draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch - prints a square, followed by a new line.

9. Fizz-Buzz - prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three prints Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints Buzz.

10. Triangles - prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic - finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - prints an integer using only _putchar().
