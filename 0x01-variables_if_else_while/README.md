#0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

	Tasks

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The source code prints whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

	- The variable n stores a different value every time you will run this program

	-You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do.

	-The output of the program is:

		- The number, followed by

			-if the number is greater than 0: is positive
	
			-if the number is 0: is zero
	
			-if the number is less than 0: is negative

	-followed by a new line

1. The last digit - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. The source code prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

	-The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program

	-You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do

	-The output of the program should be:

		-The string Last digit of, followed by

		-n, followed by

		-the string is, followed by

			-if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
			-if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
			-if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
	-followed by a new line

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

	-I only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

	-All my code is in the main function

	-putchar is only used twice in the code 

3. alphABET - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line:

	-I only use the putchar function(every other function(printf, puts, etc...)is forbidden)

	-All the code is in the main function

	-putchar is only used 3 times in the code

4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought it would pay off - prints alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line:

	-prints all letters except q and e

	-Can only use putchar function

	-All the code is in the main function
	
	-Putchar is only used twice in the code

5. Numbers - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All the code is in the main function.
6. Numberz - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line:

	-Not allowed to use any variable of type char

	-Can only use putchar function

	-Can only use putchar twice in the code

	-All the code is in the main function

7. Smile in the mirror - prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a newline:

	-Can only use putchar function

	-All code is in the main function

	-Can only use putchar twice

8. Hexadecimal - prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line:

	-Can only use putchar function

	-All code is in the main function

	-Can only use putchar 3 times

9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination of success - prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers:

	-Numbers are separated by , followed by a space

	-Numbers are printed in assending order

	-Can only use putchar function

	-All code is in the main function

	-Can ony use putchar four times

	-Not allowed to use any variable of type char

10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need - prints all possible combinations of two digits

	-Numbers are separated by , followed by a space

	-The two digits must be different

	-01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1


	-Prints only the smallest combination of two digits

	-Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits

	-Can only use putchar function

	-Can only use putchar five times maximum

	-Not allowed to use any variable of type char

	-All code is in the main function

11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do... - prints all possible different combinations of three digits:

	-Numbers are separeted by , followed by a space

	-The three digits must be diffent

	- 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2

	-Prints only the smallest combination of three digits

	-Numbers are printed in ascending ordee, with 3 digits

	-Can only use putchar function

	-Can only use putchar 6 times maximum

	-Not allowed to use any variavle of type char
